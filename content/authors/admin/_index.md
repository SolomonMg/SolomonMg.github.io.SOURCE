<!-- In my current role at Twitter, I lead an organization working on some of the hardest problems at the company:

1. How can we understand and reward the value people bring when they create content or connect with a colleague on the platform? 
2. How can we estimate value over the long term, particularly when the link between cause and effect becomes more distant?
2. How can we grapple with the short- and long-term tradeoffs between engagement and action against problematic discourse? 
3. How can we extract meaningful signal from messy, high-dimensional data to better understand that value?
4. How can we design experiments to estimate that value in the presence of substantial network- and congestion effects?

My work sits at the intersection of social science and machine learning. I've led technical teams since 2006 with regular executive communication \& public outreach -- [media fun/press clips here](#media). During the 2020 election cycle, I was Chief Scientist at [ACRONYM](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/28/us/politics/Facebook-Acronym-advertising.html), where my team drove investment by (correctly) [modeling the electoral importance of Georgia](/post/what-the-polls-got-wrong-in-2020/), leveraged hundreds of field experiments to build an [ML system to produce real-time estimates of persuasive messaging impact](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-haha-ratio-learning-from-facebooks-emoji-reactions-to-predict-persuasion-effects-of-fcd9180ea5dd), and conducted the largest ever digital advertsing field experiment (link tbd).
<!-- --an amazing collaboration with [Minali Aggarwal](https://www.linkedin.com/in/minali-aggarwal/), [Sylvan Zheng](https://sylvan.fish/), [Dan Fankowski](https://medium.com/@dfrankow) and [James Barnes](http://www.jameslbarnes.com/)-->

At Facebook, I led the technical effort to release a [differentially private data set reflecting more than an exabyte of media data](/project/condor_data_release/), and worked on prototypes that blend ML and experimentation (heterogenous effect estimation and contextual bandits). 

I founded the Data Lab at Pew Research Center, where my team conducted algorithmic audits of [Google Image searches](https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2018/12/17/gender-and-jobs-in-online-image-searches/) and [news photos on Facebook](https://www.journalism.org/2019/05/23/men-appear-twice-as-often-as-women-in-news-photos-on-facebook/), used ML to [study inauthentic and automated behavior on Twitter](https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2018/04/09/bots-in-the-twittersphere/), and used NLP to understand the role of ideology and [power structures](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/08/21/highly-ideological-members-of-congress-have-more-facebook-followers-than-moderates-do/) embedded in how members of [congress use social media to communicate](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2017/02/23/partisan-conflict-and-congressional-outreach/). 

My work on [election forecasts](publication/wlm-2019-projecting/) sparked [public debates](https://twitter.com/SolomonMg/status/1311649795258421252?s=20) about the ethics and consequences of models projecting the results of elections, and prompted [FiveThirtyEight to change their user interface](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/politics-podcast-whats-so-wrong-with-nancy-pelosi/) to address concerns raised by the work.  

My doctoral work at Stanford consisted of [research on social influence](pdf/SocialNewsCommRes.pdf) and social structure in digital environments and probably the largest study of algorithmic bias in social media, which was later published in [Science](pdf/Science-2015-Bakshy-1130-2.pdf). I also did work to uncover [bias in visual portrayals of African American candidates in political attack ads](https://solomonmg.github.io/pdf/HSVmetricsCampaignsDarknessPOQFINAL.pdf), worked with a lab at Lucile Packard Children's Hospital on a number of [imaging studies](http://pubs.rsna.org/doi/full/10.1148/radiol.11110715) and wrote a book, [*The Impression of Influence*](pdf/GrimmerWestwoodMessingBook.pdf) with [Justin Grimmer](https://www.justingrimmer.org/) and [Sean Westwood](https://www.dartmouth.edu/~seanjwestwood/) which was published by Princeton University Press.



<!-- Some past work using [privacy tech](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.04049) to [unlock research/ML](pdf/Facebook_DP_URLs_Dataset.pdf) in corporate data warehouses. 

Accidentally fell into data science in 2006 when my team couldn't get budget for Stata and so got paid for 2 years to learn R.
