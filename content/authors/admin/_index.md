Sol's team uses computational social science to advance Twitter's machine learning efforts (Cortex) and develop safeguards against algorithmic bias. He has led technical teams since 2006 with regular executive communication and public outreach. His work on social science and ML has been featured in the [New York Times, Washington Post, CBS, Wired, Vox, FastCompany, TechCrunch, and more](#media), and he's discussed it on [NPR and various podcasts](#media). 

During the 2020 election cycle, Sol was Chief Scientist at [ACRONYM](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/28/us/politics/Facebook-Acronym-advertising.html), where his team drove high-level strategic investment by [correctly modeling the electoral importance of Georgia](http://localhost:1313/post/what-the-polls-got-wrong-in-2020/), and leveraged hundreds of field experiments to build [ML systems to produce real-time estimates of persuasive messaging impact](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-haha-ratio-learning-from-facebooks-emoji-reactions-to-predict-persuasion-effects-of-fcd9180ea5dd). 

At Facebook, Sol built prototype and production ML models that power ads, page-recommendations, groups, site integrity, and social science/ethical AI efforts. He worked on advanced experimentation, using ML for heterogenous effect estimation and an early contextual bandit prototype. His team built a differentially private data platform and released a [data set reflecting more than an exabyte of media data](/project/condor_data_release/).

He also founded the Data Lab at Pew Research Center, where his team used deep learning to produce algorithmic audits of [Google Image searches](https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2018/12/17/gender-and-jobs-in-online-image-searches/) and [news photos on Facebook](https://www.journalism.org/2019/05/23/men-appear-twice-as-often-as-women-in-news-photos-on-facebook/), used ML to [study inauthentic and automated behavior on Twitter](https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2018/04/09/bots-in-the-twittersphere/), and used NLP to understand the role of ideology and [power structures](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/08/21/highly-ideological-members-of-congress-have-more-facebook-followers-than-moderates-do/) embedded in how members of [congress use social media to communicate](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2017/02/23/partisan-conflict-and-congressional-outreach/). 

Sol's doctoral work at Stanford University consisted of [foundational research](pdf/SocialNewsCommRes.pdf) on social influence and social structure in digital environments and probably the largest study of algorithmic bias in social media, which was later published in [Science](pdf/Science-2015-Bakshy-1130-2.pdf) and has thousands of citations. 

His work on [election forecasts](publication/wlm-2019-projecting/) sparked [public debates](https://twitter.com/SolomonMg/status/1311649795258421252?s=20) about the ethics and consequences of models projecting the results of elections, and prompted [FiveThirtyEight to change their user interface](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/politics-podcast-whats-so-wrong-with-nancy-pelosi/) to address concerns raised by the work.  

Sol is published in [Science](pdf/Science-2015-Bakshy-1130-2.pdf), the [American Political Science Review](pdf/EstimatingIdeologyFromFacebookPageLikes.pdf), the [Journal of Politics](pdf/aggregator.pdf), [Public Opinion Quarterly](pdf/HSVmetricsCampaignsDarknessPOQFINAL.pdf), [Communication Research](pdf/SocialNewsCommRes.pdf), [Radiology](http://pubs.rsna.org/doi/full/10.1148/radiol.11110715) and [Pediatric Radiology](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-9477.2011.00280.x/abstract). His book, [*The Impression of Influence*](pdf/GrimmerWestwoodMessingBook.pdf) with [Justin Grimmer](https://www.justingrimmer.org/) and [Sean Westwood](https://www.dartmouth.edu/~seanjwestwood/) was published by Princeton University Press.



<!-- Some past work using [privacy tech](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.04049) to [unlock research/ML](pdf/Facebook_DP_URLs_Dataset.pdf) in corporate data warehouses. 

Accidentally fell into data science in 2006 when my team couldn't get budget for Stata and so got paid for 2 years to learn R.
