Chief Scientist at Lockwood Strategy (ACRONYM). Affiliated Researcher at Georgetown. Also formerly founding Director at Pew Research Centerâ€™s [Data Labs](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/02/23/qa-with-solomon-messing-of-pew-research-centers-data-labs/) and Principal Research Scientist at Facebook. 

I use complex experimentation and modeling, behavioral data from the web, and surveys to study how people understand and react to social information. Lately I've also been working on using [privacy tech](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.04049) to [unlock research/ML](pdf/Facebook_DP_URLs_Dataset.pdf) in corporate data warehouses. 

My work has been published in [Science](pdf/Science-2015-Bakshy-1130-2.pdf), the [American Political Science Review](pdf/EstimatingIdeologyFromFacebookPageLikes.pdf), the [Journal of Politics](pdf/aggregator.pdf), [Public Opinion Quarterly](pdf/HSVmetricsCampaignsDarknessPOQFINAL.pdf), [Communication Research](pdf/SocialNewsCommRes.pdf), [Radiology](http://pubs.rsna.org/doi/full/10.1148/radiol.11110715) and [Pediatric Radiology](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-9477.2011.00280.x/abstract). My book, [*The Impression of Influence*](pdf/GrimmerWestwoodMessingBook.pdf) with Justin Grimmer and Sean Westwood, was published by Princeton University Press.
