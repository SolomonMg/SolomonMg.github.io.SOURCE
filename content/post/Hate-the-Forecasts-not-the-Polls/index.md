It’s becoming clear that the 2020 polls underestimated Trump’s support even more so than in 2016. As the Florida results poured in, many felt the same shock we felt in 2016 all over again. 

We often forget that in 2016, the national polls did quite well, getting very close to Clinton’s vote share. But the reason we were so shocked when Trump won is not because of Clinton’s polling (though state-level polling was off in both [2016](https://www.aapor.org/Education-Resources/Reports/An-Evaluation-of-2016-Election-Polls-in-the-U-S.aspx) and [2020](https://twitter.com/SolomonMg/status/1323998304238272512?s=20)). 

Rather, it was the strong expectation she would win, which was the result of a destiny-narrative driven by media coverage of election forecasting. Sean Westwood, Yph Lelkes and I recently published a [research paper](https://solomonmg.github.io/pdf/aggregator.pdf) in the Journal of Politics showing just how much additional confidence forecasts give us, and wrote about the implications for the election in a recent [USA Today op ed](https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2020/10/01/election-forecasts-can-wrong-you-still-need-vote-column/5857993002/). 

It's that massive violation of expectations is what was so disappointing to Clinton supporters and so invigorating for the MAGA crowd—the Washington elite had underestimated “real Americans” yet again. 

The result has been online rage against the polls and editorials. Some have called for us to "... [never again](https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/media/we-still-dont-know-much-about-this-election--except-that-the-media-and-pollsters-blew-it-again/2020/11/04/40c0d416-1e4a-11eb-b532-05c751cd5dc2_story.html) put as much stock in public opinion polls..." Others have said we need to "[Kick the habit](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-11-04/polling-failed-americans-need-to-kick-the-addiction)," and others have claimed this represents a "[catastrophe for American Democracy](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/11/polling-catastrophe/616986/)."

And let's be clear, there are [serious problems](https://www.vox.com/2019/1/24/18195097/jay-rosen-trump-politics-media-horse-race-recode-podcast-2020-predictions) with horserace coverage, which sacrifices coverage of substantive issues (https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1468-2508.2004.00146.x) for page clicks. And they promote what political scientist Eitan Hersh calls [political hobbyism](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/01/political-hobbyists-are-ruining-politics/605212/) — politics as sport, at the expense of local political engagement and activism.

## Why we need polls 

But survey research is critically important for the democratic process. The "[Delegate Theory of Representation](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2111003?seq=1)" requires that "constituencies must provide consistent cues regarding district preferences to their representatives."  E.J. Dionne, Jr. and Thomas E. Mann [write](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/polling-public-opinion-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly/) that "It’s especially important in democracies whose politicians claim their mandates from the people and regularly insist that they represent the views and interests of the people. To ask the people, with regularity, for their own thoughts strikes us as being both useful and a check on the claims of those in power."

And indeed members of congress often [consult polling data before making decions](https://www.historians.org/about-aha-and-membership/aha-history-and-archives/gi-roundtable-series/pamphlets/em-4-are-opinion-polls-useful-(1946)/should-congressmen-rely-on-poll-results),  advance our knowledge of public opinion polls. 



## The other problems with forecasts

We found evidence that at least in 2016, probabilistic forecasting was more prominent on left-leaning websites than on conservative sites, and more prominent on MSNBC than other cable news outlets. 

But the consequences go beyond voter turnout. FBI Director James Comey said he felt that it was his duty to write a letter to Congress saying he was reopening the investigation into candidate Hillary Clinton’s emails because he was [certain she would win](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/comey-assumption-clinton-win-factor-email-investigation/story?id=54467459). At around the same time, the Obama administration’s confidence in a Clinton victory was reportedly a factor in the muted [response to Russian intervention](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2017/world/national-security/obama-putin-election-hacking/) in the election.



## State polls versus national polls 

Part of the problem is that these forecasts rely on state-level polling to predict who will win the electoral college, which is a real mixed bag. On the one hand, you need them to understand who is likely to win each state’s electors. 

On the other hand, the error in [subnational polls is generally higher than national polls](https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/articles-reports/2016/11/11/first-thoughts-polling-problems-2016-us-elections), and the quality of state level polling adjustment lower. In 2016, state-level pollsters failed to adjust for education and consequently [underestimated Trump’s support](https://www.pewresearch.org/methods/2020/08/18/a-resource-for-state-preelection-polling/). 

While many state-level pollsters adjusted for education in 2020, Pew Research Center still found problems with state level polling this time around, for example failing to adjust for race and education simultaneously--non-college whites are far more likely to support Trump than non-college non-whites.
